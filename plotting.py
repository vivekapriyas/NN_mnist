'''
This module contains three functions that can plot some aspects of the simple 2d-points-in-a-spiral problem.
The functions can be used as is, without looking into their inner workings.
You can also use them as inspiration for other ways of visualizing what your neural net does.

    '''
    This function should make K+1 plots showing how, as the network progresses through its layers,
    the datapoints are drawn apart in such a way that they can be separated by a straight line.
    
    Y: A K+1-by-I-by-2 matrix of the values for each data point in the training set in each layer.
    C: An I-by-1 matrix of the labels corresponding to the datra points in Y.

    Make a map that shows what part of the 2d plane is classified as belonging to which spiral arm.

    forward_function: A function that takes one argument, an S-by-2 matrix of S datapoints, and
        returns a vector of S classification values.
        
        Hint: This function will use the weights you have found, so you might want it to be a method on a
        class called something like Network or Model.
    Ys: An I-by-2 matrix. Corresponding to Y[0,:,:]
    C: An I-by-1 matrix of the labels corresponding to the datra points in Ys.
